#Study HTML by Looking at Examples of Real Pages

A look at how large organisations such as the EPA make their websites. Ideal for people who want to learn computers.

This educational example contains 2 pages from a real website and links to a bunch of PDFs about different States in the USA.

Check out the HTML by looking at the index.html and by-state.html pages above.

Then see what the HTML looks like in a web browser at https://climatechanger.github.io/epa-lesson

Check out the map, it's SVG.

Fun fact! See if your State is mentioned in the list of PDFs https://climatechanger.github.io/epa-lesson/by-state.html

Have fun learning HTML and computers.
